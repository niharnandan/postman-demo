# Postman Demo

This repository contains two complementary tools for API development and testing:

## Projects

### [Postman to API Server Generator](./postman-to-api-server-generator/README.md)

Generate complete API server implementations from your Postman collections. Upload a collection, choose your framework (Express.js, Flask, or Django), and download ready-to-use server code.

### [API Explorer](./api-explorer/README.md)

Dynamically discover and visualize Express routes in real-time. Test API endpoints with an interactive UI that automatically updates as you modify your routes.

## Getting Started
