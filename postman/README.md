Installation
This project consists of a frontend React application and a backend Node.js server. You'll need to set up both to use the application.

Prerequisites
Node.js (Latest LTS version recommended)
npm (comes with Node.js)
Backend Setup
bash
# Navigate to the backend folder from the project root
cd backend

# Install backend dependencies
npm install
Frontend Setup
bash
# From the project root
npm install
Running the Application
You'll need to run both the backend server and the frontend application:

Start the Backend Server
bash
# In the backend directory
node server.js
The server will start on port 3005 by default.

Start the Frontend Application
bash
# In the project root
npm run dev
The frontend will automatically run on a different port (typically 5173) and will open in your default web browser.

How to Use
Upload Postman Collection: On the first screen, upload your Postman collection JSON file by dragging and dropping or clicking to browse.
Configure Settings:
Select your preferred framework (Express.js, Flask, or Django)
Optionally provide database connection details
Choose whether to include setup files
Add any custom instructions for code generation
Generate Code: Click "Generate Code" to create your API server implementation.
Explore & Download: Browse the generated files, view their contents, and download everything as a ZIP file.
Follow Setup Instructions: The application provides detailed instructions on how to set up and run your generated API server.
Postman Collections
This application works with standard Postman collection JSON files (v2.0 and v2.1 formats). When you export a collection from Postman:

Open Postman and navigate to your collection
Click the three dots (...) next to your collection name
Select "Export"
Choose "Collection v2.1" as the format
Save the JSON file
Upload this JSON file to the application
The application will:

Parse all requests in your collection
Maintain folder structure and organization
Visualize your API endpoints in a flow diagram
Generate server code that implements each endpoint
